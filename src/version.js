// Shown small on the menu screen.
// VERSION is edited by hand, every time a change lands - bump it and set NOTE to a short line describing
// what changed, e.g. 'AI cars now line up on the grid'. NOTE isn't shown on screen any more (removed from
// the menu), but keep filling it in anyway: it's a handy one-line changelog to glance back through.
